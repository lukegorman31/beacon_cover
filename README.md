Cover Letter for Beacon Bio :)


Dear Hiring Manager,

I am drawn to Beacon Biosignals' commitment to transforming brain health through innovative EEG technology and data-driven insights. As a professional with a solid background in both neuroscience and data analytics, I view your company as an inspiration and one in which I am extremely eager to contribute to. 

As someone who is educated in neuroscience, has gathered technical data/ML experience and has experience running my own business, I now feel I am poised to become an excellent Program Manager as Beacon. Since completing my B.Sc. in neuroscience I have long desired to build a career bridging the gap neuroscience and technology. 

During my tenure with Nokia's Advanced Consulting Services Team, I orchestrated a project involving the development of a machine learning-based customer clustering use case. From a small proof of concept and matured into a robust minimal viable product. By collaborating with cross-functional teams, including product managers, engineers, and analysts, I ensured highly effective communication and the streamlined execution of project plans working in an agile framework. My ability to adapt to shifting client requirements and uncover project dependencies aligns me perfectly with this role at Beacon.

Moreover, my experience in managing multiple data-driven projects has honed my skills in documenting comprehensive requirements and establishing clear success criteria and deliverables. I am proficient in data visualization tools like Tableau, and understand the importance of clarity and precision in written communicationâ€”a skill crucial for capturing and sharing insights with stakeholders. With a background in neuroscience, I possess a strong grasp of this field, enabling me to dive deeply into EEG analytics and contribute meaningfully to team discussions about the clinical impact of our work.

I am eager to bring my expertise in project management and data analytics to the Senior Program Manager role at Beacon Biosignals. I cannot stress enough how much I would love this opportunity.

Best,

Luke Gorman
